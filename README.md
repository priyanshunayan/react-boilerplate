# React Boilerplate

More often than not, I try to set up new react projects which have more or less the same functionality. For my usecases create-react-app seems like a overkill and it kind of abstracts all the tools. I wanted to learn the underlying tools too. So, I created this template repository for my future projects. 

This boilerplate uses:
1. Prettier - For formatting
2. Eslint - which extends react-recommended best practices and google style guide
3. Parcel - For bundling and live reloading
4. React - as a UI library
5. React-DOM - to compliment react
6. React Router - For navigation

## To run

<code> npm run dev </code>

## To build

<code> npm run build </code>

## To lint (In case of trying new editors out)

<code> npm run lint </code>

## To format (In case of trying new editors out)

<code> npm run format </code>
